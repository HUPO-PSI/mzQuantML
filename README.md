# mzQuantML

Project for the development of mzQuantML format.

The standard is now released as version 1.0 (Feb 2013).

The standard is defined by the XML Schema Document, a set of semantic rules written in natural language and encoded in validation softawre and a CV mapping file, indicating which CV terms MUST, SHOULD or MAY be used at various parts of the instance documents.

All material is available under Source. Tutorial material for implementers is also available - see Documentation folder in Source.

If you identify any problems with the format or have any queries, please use the Issues list or join the PSI-PI mailing list.
