0) CVs describing quant. workflows:
-----------------------------------
"LC/MS label-free" / "ion counting"
"SILAC"
"spectral counting"
"iTraq"
"SRM"
"14N / 15N metabolic labeling"


A) potential CV terms for layer description / type of values:
------------------------------------------------------------

for LC/MS (some overlap with other methods):
"raw feature value layer"
"normalized feature value layer"
"peptide with mods layer" (aggregate features for the pep having the same mod)
"peptide sequence layer" (aggregate values of all versions of this pep seq., regardless of which mod. or unmod.)
"peptide layer" (if we want to simplify the two preceding layers :-) )
"protein layer"
"group layer" or "experimental group layer" (contains e.g. means of protein values)
"fold change layer" (or even "protein fold change layer", "peptide fold change layer")
"standard deviation layer"
"ANOVA p-value layer"

for SILAC (some overlap with other methods):
"light/heavy peak value layer"
"peptide ratio layer"
"protein ratio layer" (corresponds to "protein fold change layer" of LC/MS?)
"group layer" (same as in LC/MS, but aggregating protein ratios)

for spectral counting:
"peptide PSM counts" (corresponds to "peptide layer" as containing peptide quantifications; no layers below this!)
"raw protein values" (sum of peptide PSM counts)
"normalized protein values"
"mean of groups" (see above)
"fold change" (see above)
...

for iTraq (some overlap with other methods):
"reporter ion raw values" (one layer for each reporter mass??)
"reporter ion normalized values"
"peptide ratios"
"protein ratios"
...

for SRM (some overlap with other methods):
"transition XIC raw value layer" (corresponds to "peptide layer" as containing peptide quantifications; no layers below this!)
"transition XIC normalized value layer" ??
"protein layer"


for 14N/15N labeling:
TODO!




B) potential CV terms for nature / aggregation / transformation / calculation of values:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"feature intensity" / "feature area" (LC/MS)
"number of MS/MS spectra" or "PSM count" (spectral counting)
"light peak intensity" / "heavy peak intensity" and "light peak area" ?? and "heavy peak area" ?? (SILAC)
"reporter ion intensity" (and area??) (iTraq)
"chromatogram area" (SRM)

"normalization" (or specific: "Progenesis normalization" with value "normalization factor"??)
"ratio of values" (or better numerator/denominator?)

"sum of values"
"mean of values"
"stddev of values"
"median of values"
"max of values" / "min of values"

"t-test p-value calculation" (semantic check: only two quant values must be referenced, both being a "mean of values")
"ANOVA p-value calculation"(semantic check: only quant values must be referenced being themselves a "mean of values" each)



C) potential CV terms for meta information of StudyVariables:
"experimental condition case" (with group number?)
"experimental condition control" (with group number?)
"experimental condition disease"
"experimental condition healthy"
"time series design, time point X" (with CV value for time point)
"dilution series design, concentration X" (with CV value for concentration)


D) quasi standard setups for raw files (not really Assays)
"one sample data set" (e.g. spectral counting)
"two sample data set" (e.g. SILAC)
"four sample data set" (e.g. iTraQ)


E) potential Feature CV terms:
"iTRAQ Feature" with semantics mandatory ref (not yet existing) to the Modification in the respective Assay
"profile Feature" regular
going along with iTRAQ: iTRAQ CV term for Assay with the semantics to forbid Assays with just one Modification (i.e. reporter ion)

F) potential data processing CV terms:
there are some terms in psi-ms.obo for data processing!
"normalization to mean of proteins" (with CV value for normlaization factor)
"quantile normalization"
"Progenesis automatic alignment" as subterm of [MS:1000745 "retention time alignment"]
"Progenesis manual alignment" as subterm of [MS:1000745 "retention time alignment"]
