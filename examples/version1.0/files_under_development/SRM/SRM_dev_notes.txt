Issues with SRM support
***********************

For SRM, potential for multiple quantitative values for a given MS1 region
	- We might choose to have one or more features to represent these
	- Agreed that Q3 m/z is a mandatory CV term for Feature
	
- We need to try converting some Waters XEVO raw data in mzML to see if SRM data are represented in <spectrum> or <chromatogram>
- Plus conversion from Thermo Vantage 

?- for absolute quantification, where a standard is spiked in, need to capture the spike-in concentration (for the reference/standard only)
	- at each peptide per assay.
	- different spike-in concentrations for each peptide within a single assay
	- not contained within the raw file/skyline output? would need manually adding? 	not feasible?

SRM CV mapping:

Discussion:	
	
	<CvMappingRule id="interpretation_must" cvElementPath="/TraML/TransitionList/Transition/IntermediateProduct/InterpretationList/Interpretation/cvParam/@accession" requirementLevel="MUST" scopePath="/TraML/TransitionList/Transition/InterpretationList/Interpretation" cvTermsCombinationLogic="AND">
	<CvTerm termAccession="MS:1000926" useTerm="true" termName="product interpretation rank" isRepeatable="false" allowChildren="false" cvIdentifierRef="MS"/>
	<CvTerm termAccession="MS:1001221" useTerm="false" termName="fragmentation information" isRepeatable="true" allowChildren="true" cvIdentifierRef="MS"/>
	<CvTerm termAccession="MS:1000903" useTerm="true" termName="product ion series ordinal" isRepeatable="false" allowChildren="false" cvIdentifierRef="MS"/> </CvMappingRule>

I think we should also make this a MUST from Feature as well - agree?

D: There seems we use a lot cvParam(s) for each Feature. If we do this way, what is the point of using FeatureQuantLayer to reduce the redundancy. For example, "product interperation rank" can be represented in FeatureQuantLayer instead of cvParam of Feature.

ARJ: For now, let's put these in as a SHOULD rule and see if we get any complaints?
