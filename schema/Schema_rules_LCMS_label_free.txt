labelfree (progenesis... maybe maxquant)

- there SHOULD not be any ms2-quantlayers anywhere (if pure LC/MS labelfree file)

- there SHOULD NOT be any Label in AssayList

- InputFiles MUST contain raw files

- FeatureQuantLayers SHOULD only be used if the PeptideConsensus QuantLayer could not be used, e.g. approaches that don't do alignment
- if alignment has been done, intensity abundance value SHOULD be reported at the PeptideQuantLayer
- if a PeptideConsensus QuantLayer is used, FeatureRefs SHOULD be given
