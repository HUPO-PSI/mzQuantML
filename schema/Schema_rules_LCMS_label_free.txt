Semantic validation rules
**************************
The parser knows this is a label-free file due to the presence of this cvParam in AnalysisSummary: "LC-MS label-free quantitation analysis"
- There MUST not be any MS2QuantLayers (unless the MS2 Tag term is also present in AnalysisSummary - same for all rules)
- There MUST NOT be any Label in AssayList 
- InputFiles MUST contain raw files
- One of PeptideConsensusList, ProteinList, ProteinGroupList SHOULD be present


Mapping file and associated rules in brackets
**********************************************
"label-free raw feature quantitation" (FeatureQuantLayer MUST be present)				= true|false  (Note - produces big files so not recommended for export - provide a warning to the user)
"label-free peptide level quantitation" (PeptideConsensusQuantLayer MUST be present)  		= true|false   (Note - post alignment)
"label-free protein level quantitation" (ProteinQL MUST be present)						= true|false
"label-free proteinGroup level quantitation" (ProteinGroupQL MUST be present)				= true|false


Implementation Notes
**********************
- FeatureQuantLayers SHOULD only be used if the PeptideConsensus QuantLayer could not be used, e.g. approaches that don't do alignment
- if alignment has been done, intensity abundance value SHOULD be reported at the PeptideQuantLayer
