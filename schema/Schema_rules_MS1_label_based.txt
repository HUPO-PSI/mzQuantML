Semantic validation rules
**************************
The parser knows this is a MS1 label-based approach due to the presence of this cvParam in AnalysisSummary: id: MS:1002018 - name: MS1 Label-based analysis
- ONE of PeptideConsensusList, ProteinList, ProteinGroupList MUST be present
- There MUST not be any MS2QuantLayers	
- The file MUST contain two or more assays references to the same rawFileGroup
- At least one of the grouped assays that reference to a common rawFileGroup MUST have the "Label/Modification" element containing a CV term for the label applied (in most cases the file will contain one of the grouped assays with the "unlabeled sample" CV term with accession="MS:1002038")
	

Mapping file and associated rules in brackets
*************************************************			
- The most common modifications for SILAC are the following, but there are a lot of more. One of these MUST appear if the Label element is present (Note: one assay in each SV MAY not have the Label for the unlabelled)
			* massDelta="8.014199", UNIMOD:259, Label:13C(6)15N(2)
			* massDelta="10.008269 ", UNIMOD:267, Label:13C(6)15N(4)

Implementation Notes
*********************
- Features are assigned to assays after peptide pairs (or triplets etc) have been identified. This is modelled within PeptideConsensus.
