SILAC
- ONE of PeptideConsensusList, ProteinList, ProteinGroupList MUST be there
	
AssayList:
	- the file SHOULD contain two or more assays references to the same rawFileGroup
	- One of the pair of assays that reference to a common rawFileGroup must have “Label” element.
	- The most common modifications for SILAC are the following, but there are a lot of more:
			* massDelta="8.014199", UNIMOD:259, Label:13C(6)15N(2)
			* massDelta="10.008269 ", UNIMOD:267, Label:13C(6)15N(4)

RatioList: MAY be there
- if numerator is referencing a StudyVariable, the denominator must to reference a StudyVariable
- if numerator is referencing an assay, the denominator must to reference an assay


PeptideConsensus: if exist,
- Features are referenced at peptideConsensus level, and in the protocol, the peptide pairs are identified before to match them ?
- MUST have Assay_refs and Feature_refs and the same number on each
- MAY have an identificationRef?

FeatureList:
- MS2AssayQuantLayer and MS2RatioQuantLayer MUST NOT exist

It MUST have one of ProteinList, ProteinGroupList or PeptideConsensus
