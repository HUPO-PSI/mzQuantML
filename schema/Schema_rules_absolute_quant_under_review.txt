**************************
The parser knows this is an absolute quantitation file due to the presence of this cvParam in AnalysisSummary: id: MS:XXXXXXX - name: absolute quantitation analysis

Exactly one of the label-free or MS1 label-based cv terms MUST be presnet in AnalysisSummary:

MS:1001834: "LC-MS label-free quantitation analysis"
MS:1002018: "MS1 Label-based analysis"

- The following MuST be present in AnalysisSummary with values of ture of false :

MS:XXXXXXX: "peptide internal reference used" (an AssayQuantLayer of "internal reference abundance" MUST be present in PeptideConsensusList) = 	true|false
MS:XXXXXXX: "protein internal reference used" (an AssayQuantLayer of "internal reference abundance" MUST be present in ProteinList = 	true|false


- If either value of CV term "peptide internal reference used" or "protein internal reference used" is true, there MUST be a AssayQuantLayer in PeptideConsensusList or ProteinList respectively, of data type -- "internal reference abundance", with appropriate unit.

- There SHOULD be at least one peptide-level, protein-level or protein group-level AssayQuantLayer containing absolute abundance values for all peptides or proteins.
