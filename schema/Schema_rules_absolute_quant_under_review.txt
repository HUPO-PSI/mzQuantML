Semantic validation rules
**************************
The parser knows this is an absolute quantitation file due to the presence of this cvParam in AnalysisSummary: id: MS:XXXXXXX - name: absolute quantitation analysis

Exactly one of the following cv terms MUST also be present in AnalysisSummary, and the validator follows all existing rules for these techniques.

MS:1001834: "LC-MS label-free quantitation analysis"
MS:1002018: "MS1 Label-based analysis"
MS:1001836: "spectral counting quantitation analysis"
MS:1002023: "MS2 Tag-based analysis"

The following term MAY also be used if an SRM analysis has been performed in label-free or MS1 label-based mode:

MS:1001838 - name: SRM quantitation analysis

The following MUST both be present in AnalysisSummary with values of true of false :

MS:XXXXXXX: "peptide internal reference used" (if true, an AssayQuantLayer of "internal reference abundance" MUST be present in PeptideConsensusList) 
MS:XXXXXXX: "protein internal reference used" (if true, an AssayQuantLayer of "internal reference abundance" MUST be present in ProteinList)

- If either value of CV term "peptide internal reference used" or "protein internal reference used" is true, there MUST be a AssayQuantLayer in PeptideConsensusList or ProteinList respectively, of data type -- "internal reference abundance", with appropriate unit.

- There SHOULD be at least one peptide-level, protein-level or protein group-level AssayQuantLayer containing absolute abundance values for all peptides or proteins.
