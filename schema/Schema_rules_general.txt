- All object references of type IDREFS or IDREF should match the correct object type
[- if there is a SmallMoleculeList, there MUST NOT be a ProteinGroupList, ProteinList, PeptideConsensusList, FeatureList ] This rule may not be wanted
[- if there is a PeptideList, ProteinList or ProteinGroupList there MUST NOT be a SmallMoleculeList]
[- If there is a StudyVariableList, there MUST be Assay_refs within]
[- if there is ProteinList, it MUST contain ONE of GlobalQuantLayer, AssayQuantLayer, RatioQuantLayer, StudyVariabeQuantLayer] - Note from Andy: I'm not sure I agree with this. One could report Proteins in a ProteinList, but put the quant values in ProteinGroupList for example
- number of "columns" in every type of QuantLayer Row must be equal to number of items in <ColumnIndex>
- An object MUST not be occur twice as a <Row> in any QuantLayer
- If there is a ProteinList and a PeptideConsensusList, all proteins SHOULD have peptide_refs
- There MUST be a cvParam in AnalysisSummary for the type of technique (this will be done by the mapping file)
- The follow cvParams MUST be present:

<cvParam cvRef="PSI-MS" accession="" name="ProteinGroupQuantLayers" value="false"/>
<cvParam cvRef="PSI-MS" accession="" name="ProteinQuantLayers" value="true"/>
<cvParam cvRef="PSI-MS" accession="" name="PeptideConsensusQuantLayer" value="true"/>
<cvParam cvRef="PSI-MS" accession="" name="FeatureQuantLayer" value="false"/>

- If the cvParam values states that a particular type of QuantLayer is present, then at least one quant layer must be present
- There MUST be at least one QuantLayer in a file

- If there is a ProteinGroupList, ProteinList or PeptideConsensusList, there SHOULD be SearchDatabase
- The number of Rows in any QuantLayer MAY be different to number of elements in the parent list (e.g. you do not need to report a row of values for every protein)
- the same protein accession MAY appear more than once in the protein list, for example differing in <Modification>
- same pepetide sequence MAY appear more than once in the PeptdieConsensusList, for example differing in <Modification>
