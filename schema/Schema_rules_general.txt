Semantic validation rules
**************************
Failure of a rule with a MUST causes a file to be INVALID
Failure of a rule with a SHOULD causes a WARNING to be produced

- All object references of type IDREFS or IDREF MUST match the correct object type
- The number of data values in every Row of a QuantLayer MUST be equal to number of items in <ColumnIndex>
- The value in object_ref in <Row> MUST NOT be duplicated in any (i.e. check these are unique)
- If there is a ProteinList and a PeptideConsensusList, all proteins SHOULD have peptide_refs
- If the cvParam values in AnalysisSummary states that a particular type of QuantLayer is present, then at least one quant layer MUST be present
- If there is a ProteinGroupList, ProteinList or PeptideConsensusList, there SHOULD be SearchDatabase
- The number of Rows in any QuantLayer MAY be different to number of elements in the parent list (e.g. you do not need to report a row of values for every protein)
- In the RatioList, if the numerator is referencing a StudyVariable, the denominator MUST reference a StudyVariable
- In the RatioList, if the numerator is referencing an Assay, the denominator MUST reference an Assay

Mapping file additions and associated rules
*********************************************
- There MUST be ONE or MORE cvParams in AnalysisSummary for the general type of technique. We support four techniques in level 1 release (add following cvParams where they do not already exist): 
"MS2 Tag-based analysis"  (General term needed? Otherwise we could just use specific terms for iTRAQ / TMT etc?)
"MS1 Label-based analysis" (General term needed? Otherwise we could just use specific terms for SILAC / N15 etc?)
id: MS:1001834 - name: LC-MS label-free quantitation analysis
id: MS:1001836 - name: spectral counting quantitation analysis


Additional notes or discussed rules not currently to implement
****************************************************************

- The same protein accession MAY appear more than once in the protein list, for example differing in <Modification>
- The same peptide sequence MAY appear more than once in the PeptdieConsensusList, for example differing in <Modification>

[- if there is a SmallMoleculeList, there MUST NOT be a ProteinGroupList, ProteinList, PeptideConsensusList, FeatureList ] This rule may not be wanted
[- if there is a PeptideList, ProteinList or ProteinGroupList there MUST NOT be a SmallMoleculeList]
[- if there is ProteinList, it MUST contain ONE of GlobalQuantLayer, AssayQuantLayer, RatioQuantLayer, StudyVariabeQuantLayer] - Note from Andy: I'm not sure I agree with this. One could report Proteins in a ProteinList, but put the quant values in ProteinGroupList for example
[- There MUST be at least one QuantLayer in a file] Note: Not clear that this is needed

Proposal for CV Terms in AnalysisSummary:
MS1 Label-based raw feature quantitation (FeatureQuantLayer MUST be present)		= true|false  (Note - produces big files so not recommended for export)
MS1 Label-based peptide level quantitation (PeptideConsensusQuantLayer MUST be present)  		= true|false
MS1 Label-based protein level quantitation (ProteinQL MUST be present)						= true|false
MS1 Label-based proteinGroup level quantitation (ProteinGroupQL MUST be present)				= true|false
