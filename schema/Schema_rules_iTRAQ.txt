- iTRAQ-Reagent type MUST be present in Assay modification element
- Label, recommendation to use PSI-MOD IDs
- Each Assay element MUST reference exactly one iTRAQ reagent
- If PeptideConsensusList is present there MUST be a FeatureList present and there MUST be a MS2Quantlayer present. Feature_ref MUST be present in PeptideConsensus.
- InputFiles MUST contain raw files
- If there is a MS2StudyVariableQuantLayer there SHOULD be a MS2AssayQuantLayer
- Each PeptideConsensus MUST report one or more Features
- More than one feature reference from PeptideConsensus implies that multiple features report on the same peptide
- PeptideConsensusList SHOULD NOT have any QuantLayers, unless multiple features are summed for each peptide, in which case the various QuantLayers MAY be used.
