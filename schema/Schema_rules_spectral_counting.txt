spectral count:
- ONE of PeptideConsensusList, ProteinList, ProteinGroupList MUST be there
- In InputFiles there SHOULD be IdentificationFiles 
[- There SHOULD NOT be RawFiles unless RawFiles were used directly for quantification without a separate identification step]- Note from ARJ: Hard to check this
- in AssayList there MUST NOT be Label, MUST NOT be RawFilesGroup_Refs
- in AssayList there MUST be IdentificationFile_Refs
- if there is PeptideConsensusList, it MUST NOT contain <Feature_refs> and MUST NOT contain <Assay_refs>
- There SHOULD NOT be a FeatureList, and therefore no FeatureQuantLayer (Note: A user might want to report Features in terms of m/z and RT values for some purpose)

not real rules ;-):
[- if there is ProteinList, it MAY contain PeptideConsensus_refs
- if there is ProteinList, it MAY contain IdentificationRef
- RatioList MAY be there ]
