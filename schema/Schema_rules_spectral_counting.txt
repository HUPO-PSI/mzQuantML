spectral count:
- ONE of PeptideConsensusList, ProteinList, ProteinGroupList MUST be there
- In InputFiles there SHOULD be IdentificationFiles 
[- There SHOULD NOT be RawFiles unless RawFiles were used directly for quantification without a separate identification step]- Note from ARJ: Hard to check this
- in AssayList there MUST NOT be Label, 
- There MUST be at least one of RawFilesGroup_Refs or IdentificationFile_Refs
- There SHOULD NOT be a FeatureQuantLayer 

not real rules ;-):
[- if there is ProteinList, it MAY contain PeptideConsensus_refs
- if there is ProteinList, it MAY contain IdentificationRef
- RatioList MAY be there ]
