Semantic validation rules
**************************
The parser knows this is a spectral count file due to the presence of this cvParam in AnalysisSummary: id: MS:1001836 - name: spectral counting quantitation analysis
- One of PeptideConsensusList, ProteinList, ProteinGroupList MUST be present
- There MUST be at least one of rawFilesGroup_Ref or identificationFile_Refs in Assay
- There SHOULD NOT be a FeatureQuantLayer

Mapping file and associated rules in brackets
**********************************************
Proposal for CV Terms in AnalysisSummary:
"spectral count Peptide level quantitation" (PeptideConsensusQuantLayer MUST be present) 		= true|false   (Note - if counts are done at the peptide sequence level)
"spectral count Protein level quantitation" (ProteinQL MUST be present)						= true|false
"spectral count ProteinGroup level quantitation" (ProteinGroupQL MUST be present)				= true|false

Implementation Notes
**********************
[- There SHOULD NOT be RawFiles unless RawFiles were used directly for quantification without a separate identification step]- Note from ARJ: Hard to check this
[- if there is ProteinList, it MAY contain PeptideConsensus_refs
- if there is ProteinList, it MAY contain IdentificationRef
- RatioList MAY be there ]
